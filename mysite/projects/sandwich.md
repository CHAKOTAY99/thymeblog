# 🥪 How to Make a Simple and Delicious Vegetarian Sandwich

Sometimes, the best projects are the ones you can eat. In this post, I’ll show you how to make a basic vegetarian sandwich that’s easy to prepare, customizable, and satisfying.

Whether you're packing lunch for work or just want a quick snack, this sandwich hits the spot.

## 🧺 Ingredients You'll Need

Here’s a list of fresh, simple ingredients:

- **2 slices of whole-grain bread** (or bread of your choice)
- **1 ripe tomato**, sliced
- **1/2 cucumber**, sliced thin
- **1/4 red onion**, thinly sliced
- **Lettuce or spinach leaves**
- **1 slice of cheddar or mozzarella** (optional)
- **Hummus or mayonnaise** (as a spread)
- **Salt and pepper** to taste
- **Olive oil and vinegar** (optional, for extra flavor)

## 🔧 Steps to Assemble

1. **Toast the bread** (optional but adds a nice crunch).
2. **Spread hummus or mayo** on one or both slices of bread.
3. **Layer the vegetables**: start with lettuce, then tomato, cucumber, and onion.
4. **Add cheese** if using.
5. **Season lightly** with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil or vinegar if you like.
6. **Top with the second slice** of bread, press gently, and cut in half.

That's it—done in under 10 minutes!

## 🧠 Why It Works

- **Balance**: Creaminess from hummus or mayo, crunch from vegetables, softness from bread.
- **Nutrition**: It’s loaded with fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats.
- **Versatility**: You can swap in avocado, sprouts, grilled veggies, or even an egg for variety.

## 🍽 Serving Ideas

- Serve with a side of fruit or veggie chips.
- Pair with a smoothie or iced tea for a full lunch.
- Make mini versions as party finger food.
